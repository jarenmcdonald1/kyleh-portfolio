Have you ever heard of Magnesium? 


I like to call it the Jack of all trades when it comes to supplements. 


Magnesium has this superpower of basically helping out each of your body's systems and supporting all processes including the brain. 


Here are some of the benefits...


- - -


### Magnesium is involved in hundreds of biochemical reactions in the body


- - -


* Around 60% of Magnesium in your body is found within the bone. The other 40% is found within soft tissue, fluids (blood), and muscle. 
* All cells within the body require Magnesium to operate properly.
* Magnesium is involved in;

  1. Energy creation - converts food into energy
  2. Gene maintenance - helps to protect and repair DNA and RNA
  3. Protein creation - helps to build proteins from amino acids
  4. Movement - plays a role in the contraction and relaxation of muscles
  5. Nervous System - helps to regulate neurotransmitters, which send messages to and from the brain

### Important for Exercise-based Performance


- - -


* Magnesium is required in more of a surplus when exercising!

  * Just like with most vitamins and minerals, when your body is performing at higher than normal levels all your micronutrients will be needed in higher supply!
* Magnesium aids in putting sugars into the muscles to increase performance.
* It is able to remove lactic acid before it is able to build up within the muscle. This build up can cause a decrease in energy levels and greater fatigue.


- - -


### Decrease In Blood Pressure


- - -


* Magnesium is responsible for the relaxing of muscles.

  * Magnesium works with Calcium to both produce the contraction (flex) caused by Calcium and the relaxation (release) caused by Magnesium.
* When you supplement with Magnesium this decrease in the contraction of muscles can allow for passageways for blood to open up, which will, therefore, decrease blood pressure by providing more room to flow.

### Anti-Inflammatory


- - -


* Magnesium regulates cellular events involved in inflammation. 

  * It is the team leader and watches over most processes. 
* A magnesium imbalance can cause an inflammatory response to be called-on and therefore, create build-ups. 
* In other words, magnesium literally chills inflammation right out. Therefore, an increase in magnesium causes a decrease in the inflammatory response. Leading to a quicker recovery. 


- - -


### Regularity


- - -


* Magnesium aids in releasing muscles. When you flex your muscle you both need to contract (flex) and relax (release). We need both these functions to be working efficiently for many purposes in the body. 
* A large reason to have these systems working effectively is to increase regularity. 

  * Yes, I'm talking about your body's waste removal system...remember, everybody poops, ok?
* Your bowels contract and release to help your waste travel through while collecting valuable nutrients and separating from the waste. When you are low on Magnesium this will cause a blockage and a decrease in production, also knows as constipation. 
* Keeping adequate levels of Magnesium and also Calcium can greatly improve your regularity in terms of waste management!

### Helps to Reduce Headaches & PMS Symptoms


- - -


* Studies show low quantities of Magnesium are found in people who experience Headaches as well as women who experience PMS symptoms.

  * Both of which (Headaches and PMS) can be linked to inflammation.
* Due to Magnesium's ability to decrease inflammation, ensuring we have adequate doses will enable less risk for Headches or PMS Symptoms. 
* Magnesium helps to relax the muscles that are likely contracting in both instances, allowing for less pain with either a Headache or painful PMS Symptoms.

### Sleep


- - -


* We all know how important sleep is, and so many people struggle to get a good quality or quantity of sleep each night.

  * I am certainly guilty of not always getting adequate sleep!
* Due to the fact that Magnesium is responsible for relaxing the muscles, it is a good idea to include a Magnesium supplement into your nighttime routine.
* In no way is it going to lull you to sleep, but it will help you start the relaxation process that will enable you to get enough sleep to face tomorrow feeling your best!

### Other sources of Magnesium


- - -


* Not everyone can take a supplement. In these cases, we have to continue to make sure that we are getting enough from our food! 

  * I personally like to both take a supplement as well as focus on getting good quantities within my diet. 
* Dark leafy greens like spinach and chard are some of the best foods you can eat. One cup of either contains about 40% of the recommended daily value of magnesium.
* Other foods that contain magnesium include:

  * seeds, like pumpkin or squash seeds
  * broccoli
  * almonds
  * mackerel, tuna, and Pollock fish
  * low-fat yogurt or kefir
  * black beans and lentils
  * avocado
  * figs
  * bananas
  * dark chocolate

See, I told you Magnesium has superpowers!

*I say while smiling and nodding*


I ensure that I am getting it both in my food and as a supplement to allow myself to get all the benefits associated! It is always beneficial to try to get it through whole foods first, and then as a supplement second.

Make sure you're getting your proper intake of Magnesium everyday in order to enjoy all the benefits!
