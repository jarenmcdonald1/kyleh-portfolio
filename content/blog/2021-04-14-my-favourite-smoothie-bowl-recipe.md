Iâ€™ve been obsessed with smoothie bowls lately...

Maybe it's because I've never loved breakfast foods, and this just seems like a breakfast ice cream...? Who knows?

Smoothie bowls are amazing for so many reasons;

* They are nutrient-dense. 

  * By combining so many **superfoods** (a food that is rich in compounds that will boost ones' health) into one blended smoothie bowl can provide you with a high dose of many vitamins and minerals required to sustain you throughout the day. These vitamins and minerals are; Vitamin C, Vitamin A, Vitamin B, amino acids, Magnesium, Potassium, Zinc, and Iron to list a few. 
* They are rich in all the macronutrients.

  * Eating meals with all the **macronutrients** (protein, carbohydrates, and fat) is essential in keeping you fueled long term. By creating recipes that contain all three of these **macronutrients** you will fuel your body in a lasting fashion. If you do not eat foods rich in all three at mealtimes, you can often find yourself crashing earlier than you should. Keeping your glucose levels steady by incorporating all the macronutrients. 
* They are rich in antioxidants.

  * Foods that tend to be richer in colour also tend to be richer in **antioxidants** (antioxidants are compounds that prevent oxidation. Oxidation is a chemical reaction that can produce free radicals, of which can damage cells). By adding fruit that is antioxidant-rich can make for an all-around boost for your cells, to prevent damage caused by free radicals.

Now knowing all these wonderful things, aren't you kinda ready for a smoothie bowl? Here's my current favourite recipe, totally customizable of course!

##### Prep Time: 10 mins

Keywords: antioxidants, healthy breakfast, protein, superfood, macronutrients, rich, whole foods

#### EQUIPMENT

* Blender



#### INGREDIENTS

* 1/3 cup oat milk or your milk of choice
* 3/4 cup frozen dragon fruit (you can sub in whatever frozen fruit you would like)
* 1/3 cup of frozen raspberries (or any berries you would prefer)
* 1/3 cup of frozen avocado
* 2 medium ripe bananas (previously peeled, and frozen)
* 1 heaping handful of spinach (yes, we have to get the greens in there)
* 3/4 cup scoop Sunwarrior Vanilla Protein Powder or protein powder of your choice (preferably a vegetarian source)



#### INSTRUCTIONS

1. To a blender, add frozen dragon fruit, frozen raspberries, banana, avocado, spinach, protein powder, and dairy-free milk (starting with lower end of range). Blend until creamy and smooth. The trick to a thick smoothie bowl is being patient and blending slowly, adding only as much liquid as necessary, and using a smoothie wand (or something comparable that's blender safe) to scrape the sides down as it blends.
2. Taste and adjust flavour as needed, adding more banana for sweetness, dairy-free milk for creaminess, or berries for more intense berry flavour.
3. Divide between serving bowls and enjoy as is or top with fresh fruit, granola, hemp hearts, coconut, bee pollen, chia seeds, nuts and seeds, and flax meal (optional).
4. Best when fresh. Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 24 hours. Freeze for longer-term storage. Or freeze in ice cube mold to use in future smoothies.
