Peaches are so yummy, fresh, and in-season here in Ontario for the summer. This makes them the ultimate choice for any sweet or savoury dishes throughout the summer. 


Packed with dietary fiber, vitamin C, vitamin A, and antioxidants, these sweet treats are an awesome addition to any creation. 

For me, I wanted to create a fun way to enjoy the sweetness in the morning without getting a sugar crash a little later on.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, breakfast isn't my favourite meal, but the more I look for in season and fresh ingredients to add to my breakfast the more I appreciate breakfast and all it's benefits throughout my day.
