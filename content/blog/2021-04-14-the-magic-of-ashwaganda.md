## THE MAGIC OF ASHWAGANDHA


- - -


Feeling overwhelmed? **Ashwagandha will save you with all your stress-related fatigue needs.**



Have you heard of Ashwagandha before?


Well first to help you out, here’s how to pronounce it (*ash-wa-gand-a*).


Now, we are all way too stressed out these days. **Especially THESE DAYS**. The world is mess, work is uncertain and nerve-wracking, family is separated, loved ones are far away, social lives are strained, grocery shopping puts you at risk, equality is still an un-won fight, and leadership is leading so many astray.


All of that being true, **stress is inevitable**. It’s not wrong to feel stressed out, I truly don’t know how you could manage to not be stressed in the world’s current climate.


All that being said, **stress has a lot of negative effects on the body’s operations, and functions**.


To put it in basic terms it **decreases efficiency** and creates more hoops to jump through which only further **distracts from completing functions.**

Now for the details…


Your body goes into **fight or flight under stress** and your brain sends messages and hormones to respond to this initial reaction. When you are stressed out your body releases **cortisol** as a reaction to the fight or flight response, when your body is constantly releasing cortisol, it can have some effects overall on the body.


The trouble is, it can affect different parts of the body on each individual person, so though it is hard to pinpoint, lowering overall stress levels with the help of a traditional Herb **Ashwagandha**.

##### The Brain…


The stress response starts just above the shoulders, where a cluster of cells processes emotional data. Here a message is sent to the **hypothalamus**, which tells your body to protect you from attack. This is a nervous system response that causes an **increased heart rate, constriction of the blood vessels** (blood won’t travel to necessary body parts as efficiently), **slows the intestines, blocks digestive progress, and prompts the body to respond by flooding the body with cortisol.**


If this reaction resulting in high levels of cortisol release it can cause serious physical damage to the body. When your body is **constantly in this high state of cortisol** you can start to experience something called **Hippocampal Brain Damage** where the result is **disturbed sleep cycles, you can get moody, you can experience memory loss and brain fog.**


##### The Pituitary Gland…


The pituitary gland is often called the **master gland** and is located in the mid-section of the brain. It is responsible for keeping our body in **homeostasis**, or in a state of normal. This includes **keeping body temperature, thyroid activity and urine production**. This explains why you get sweaty palms or have a nervous pee when under pressure. When stressed, the pituitary gland produces a hormone called **Adrenocorticotropic** (ACTH), which causes the adrenal glands to **produce cortisol**. **Cortisol increases blood pressure, pulls glucose from fat from body tissues into the bloodstream for energy**, and this explains why appetite decreases when you exercise.


The pituitary gland also releases a **thyroid-stimulating hormone, which produces thyroxine.** **Thyroxine increases the metabolic rate, raises blood-sugar levels, increases respiration, heart rate, and blood pressure** – all needed to fulfill a quick burst of activity, this uses up nutrients too quickly. This causes the body to call on B vitamins too heavily and excretes magnesium.


##### The Heart…


Blood vessels **constrict** or close during the stress response, which makes it **harder for the heart to pump**. When the blood pressure is heightened, the blood vessels are constricted, with increased cortisol, and thyroxine, it only further **worsens inflammation and plaque development**.


With increased blood pressure and overproduction of these hormones, can cause too much stress on the heart leading to a build-up of low-density cholesterol (LDL) and high-density cholesterol (HDL) which can lead to heart complications.



##### The Adrenal Glands…


When your body detects stress, the **hypothalamus signals the nervous system** to secrete two hormones – **adrenaline and noradrenaline** – into the bloodstream. These increase the heart rate, and blood pressure. Blood gets sent to the extremities as if ready to go into battle, **digestion gets halted** which is why you feel butterflies in the stomach. When this process is repeated regularly with no time for rest, or recovery between, you start to feel both tired, and wound up – **tired but wired**.


**Chronic stress also wears out the adrenal glands** by overusing the back storage of adrenaline. This can cause **adrenal fatigue** which can leave you with **exhaustion, physical weakness, immune suppression, hormone imbalances, skin problems, and depression.**



##### The Stomach and Intestines…


The slowing of the digestive system is triggered by the **sympathetic nervous system**. This is in an effort to provide the body with more blood and more nutrients where it is most needed. The body is very smart this way. However, this reduction of digestion, can lead to **decreased nutrient absorption, increased bloating, poor skin health, decreased energy, mood swings, and brain fog**.

These are just the main effects an overdose of stress has on the body.


It is a bit of a vicious cycle of stress-causing more effects on the body which in turn causes more stress.


Now, we can’t fix this with a food, or a better stress-reducing practice. But, implementing these things that can reduce stress, and help you decrease heart rate, and blood constrictions, improve digestion and circulate nutrients throughout the body will in turn help it become more manageable.

Today, we are here to talk about **Ashwagandha**.

Ashwagandha is an apoptogenic herb, who’s claim to fame is the ability to **decrease stress-related fatigue.**


##### It is an Ancient Medicinal Herb…


Ashwagandha is a medicinal herb used for 3000 years to relieve stress, naturally, **increase energy levels**, and **improve concentrations**.


##### Can reduce Blood Sugar Levels…


Due to the effects, Ashwagandha has on Insulin Secretion, and the ability to **reduce secretion and improve Insulin Sensitivity** in Muscles it can overall **decrease the blood sugar levels** in both people with and without Diabetes.


##### Known to have Anti-Cancer Properties…


Ashwagandha can **impede the growth of new cancer cells** in a couple different ways.


It is believed to **promote the formation of Reactive Oxygen Species** (ROS) inside cancer cells which disrupts their function.


It is also causing **cancer cells to become less resistant to regular cell turnover**, which will help to rid of these cancer cells, unlike the way they are usually able to overcome this change over in cells.


##### Reduces Cortisol Levels…


Cortisol, as we have discussed, is a **stress hormone** that is released by the adrenal glands, in response to stress, the same goes for when your blood sugar becomes too low.


We know that high levels of Cortisol can have adverse effects on the body.


This is something we can actually help with the use of Ashwagandha. By the aid of reducing stress-related fatigue with the help of Ashwagandha, we are able to see a decrease in Cortisol levels due to a reduction in the release of Stress Hormones, which in turn help to **reduce the production of Cortisol**.


##### Reduces Inflammation…


Ashwagandha is known to **increase the overall function and activity of natural killer cells**. These are specialized immune cells that fight infection, help you stay healthy and help you perform at the highest level possible.


These natural killer cells are also known to help **decrease inflammation**. When your body has limited inflammation, all operations function much more efficiently!



##### Might Even Improve Cognitive Function…


Ashwagandha is known to be **super high antioxidants** that protect nerve cells from free radical invaders. By reducing inflammation, increasing proper blood and nutrient flow, and using antioxidants to fight invaders your braid has **less oxidative stress** and receives higher dosages of blood and essential nutrients, which then helps it operate at a much higher level. This is why it is commonly used to **increase Memory, and Cognitive Function.**

Stress is completely normal, let’s not kid ourselves, **we’re all stressed.**

Ashwagandha is a great way to make it much easier to handle. No, it’s not going to get rid of all your stress, but it will certainly help **bring the stress to a manageable level**, where you can still operate, and all the side effects of stress are at a level that won’t stop you from embracing each day and welcoming the challenges.


I know it might sound easier than it truly is, but these small additions to our days can make all the difference in turning what would normally derail us, into a small barely detectable bump on the road.
