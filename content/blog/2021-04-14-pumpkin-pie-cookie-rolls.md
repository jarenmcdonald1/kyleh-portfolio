# PUMPKIN PIE COOKIE ROLLS



- - -



‘Tis the season for everything **Pumpkin**.


Just like the majority of us, I’m a huge Pumpkin sucker.


I’m a huge sucker for any sweet dessert that includes Pumpkin.

I love it so much that I once had Pumpkin Pie for my birthday because **I’m so obsessed**.

I **LOVE** dessert but I don’t like the common side effects that go along with a lot of refined sugars and an overdose on sweets.


- - -


**First of all…**


*Sugar is incredibly addictive.* Once you get on a loop of having lots of sugar, your body craves it more, which in turn makes you consume it more often. It is a very dangerous track to be on.


**Secondly…**


*Sugar decreases the body’s immune system functions!* Sugar suppresses the immune system from doing its job in protecting you, instead, it distracts the immune system opening you up to be vulnerable for pathogens, bacteria, or worse to infiltrate your system.


**Finally...**


*Sugar increases stress.* Yes, we all know when we are stressed we often turn to sugar. This is because the taste of the sweet treat helps to release a “happy” hormone. However, it also releases the fight or flight hormones known as cortisol, adrenaline, and epinephrine. These are released to give us energy, however, they also leave the body and mind feeling more anxious, irritable, and shaky.


None of which we want to experience when we are already feeling stressed out.



There are a lot more reasons why sugar can be harmful to the body, which I know is sad because who doesn’t love a sweet treat every once in a while.


It is for this reason that I like to create and find recipes that include **Refined Sugar-Free Treats**.

**These curb that sweet craving** without s**piking blood sugar**, **decreasing immunity**, or **leading me to become more addicted to sugar and sweets.**


Since it is fall, after all, I thought I would create a lovely pumpkin dessert that curbs any craving but also gives a healthy quantity of fat, and protein to help slow the release of the unrefined sugars without sacrificing any flavour.
