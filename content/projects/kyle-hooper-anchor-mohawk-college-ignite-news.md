A podcast series that I created for MP1st (currently on hold as I have a very busy schedule). The series came to me as an idea because my gamers struggle with long-running game series that have a lot of stories that can be hard to catch up on when new entries come out. I planned an episode around a long-running game series then reached out to many content creators that created content around the lore of these games. 

Getting an insight into good starting points and story beats that many gamers might not pick up on.

You can check out episode one above or listen to episode two [here](https://jimmydv.podbean.com) (I actually remembered to turn on my higher-quality microphone in episode two).
