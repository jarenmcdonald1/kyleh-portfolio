Houndstooth Print Works is based out of Windsor, Ontario. A couple started the business together but were struggling to convert clicks into sales. Our team created a social media guidebook and helped change the colour palette for branding. I took on the task of getting a blog set up and doing keyword research and backlinking for the blog. We also created email templates for local business partnerships to help boost their brand's awareness. I interviewed the couple about how their print process worked and created a blog to go alongside some video content that showcases the apparel printing process they go through with every order. They are also very dedicated to the environment, and I noticed they had bamboo clothing listed, but the couple didn't highlight the clothing enough on the site. I created a blog focusing on bamboo apparel and questions people were asking on Google about it.
