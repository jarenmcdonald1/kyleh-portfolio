With COVID-19 being in the way, all of our third-year courses were now to be done at home, including our documentary class. I accepted the challenge, and with my partner, we set out to make a short documentary on how veganism is today. Everything was shot using phones or Zoom calls. I edited everything and did the voice-over while also helping to conduct the interviews we needed. My partner and I did all of this work remotely, and the only way we could have completed this is with amazing communication. We both had a calendar we tracked our process with and had brainstorming sessions where we would sit on zoom over lunch and talk about any ideas we might have. It was a great experience and gave me a much clearer understanding of how working remotely still requires great teamwork and clear communication.
