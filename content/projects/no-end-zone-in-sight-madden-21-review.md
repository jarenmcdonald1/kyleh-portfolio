With August coming to a close, football fans rejoice! The 2020/2021 NFL Season will be kicking off soon ( although with no fans in the stadiums, thanks corona) and with that comes another yearly installment of Madden.



Score: 5/10



Pros:

* The Yard is a fun new addition
* Sound design is top notch
* New lineman stick gives more choice to rush or block


Cons:

* Graphics are a little dated
* Little to no improvement in franchise mode
* MUT still main game mode EA pushes
* Presentation needs massive improvement
