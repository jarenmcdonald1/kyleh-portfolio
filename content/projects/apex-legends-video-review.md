As you can probably tell, I really enjoy video games. For our video editing class, I wanted to do a video review that is the type you would see on websites and YouTube for people who are looking for information on a game before playing it. I did all of the video captures on my Xbox, then ported it over to Premiere, where I did the voice-over on it.
