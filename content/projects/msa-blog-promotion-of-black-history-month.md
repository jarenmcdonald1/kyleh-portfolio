description: The 3rd year journalism students needed help promoting their
  stories for Black History Month
---
Black History Month is important to us, so when my journalism program was writing stories highlighting people of colour in the Hamilton area, I wanted to get some more attraction to it. I pitched an idea to the MSA president, which involved me writing a preview blog post, highlighting some of the amazing people we had for the Black History Month Issue, and he loved the idea. I asked a few of my classmates to give me point form information on one of their profiles, and I then crafted a blog post using that info. I kept it short because students need information fast.
