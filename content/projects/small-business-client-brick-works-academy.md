Brick Works Academy is based out of London, Ontario. They run camps for kids who are interested in all things geeky. From Lego, robotics, video games and even Harry Potter. When the pandemic hit, Brick Works was forced to bring its camps online. With more camps moving digitally, it started to get overcrowded with many start-up virtual camps. We helped Brick Works enhance its website to bring in more traffic and convert those clicks to camp sign-ups. We created social media guides for them and I created a blog with three posts to get them started. I also created the meta descriptions for their different camps and did keyword research to enhance the SEO on the blog posts.
