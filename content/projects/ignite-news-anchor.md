My on-camera work was limited in my final year because of COVID-19, but I made the most of it. Being the anchor of the newscast, I needed to be up to date with any last-minute script changes and speak clearly and fluently. I made sure to dress the part, and I got great experience to calm nerves when doing on-camera work. I have no trouble doing on-camera work, and much of that comes from the practice I got from my program.



Please scrub to the 38-second mark for the newscast to begin.
