## Get Started

1. üì¶ Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

2. üèó Run the project for local dev. This will start a hot-reloading server at `localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. üåå Build the app for server-side rendered deployment. See more about **Universal SSR** in the [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org/guide#server-rendered-universal-ssr-).

```bash
npm run build

# And to serve that deployment...
npm run start
```

4. ‚ö°Ô∏è Generate a fully pre-rendered static site. See more [in the docs](https://nuxtjs.org/guide#static-generated-pre-rendering-).

```bash
npm run generate
```

### Personalize setup

1. Copy and change the .env-file

   - `cp .env-example .env`
   - Then change the values

2. Change the value on these lines

   - `static/admin/config.yml` ‚Äî `site_url` & `logo_url`
   - `content/site/info.json` ‚Äî `sitename`, `sitedescription` & `sitelang`
   - `package.json` ‚Äî `name`, `description`, `author` & `repository.url`
   - `pages/index.vue` ‚Äî The start page of your new website!

3. Change colors, favicon, content & content collections

   - Colors are managed in `assets/scss/_vars.scss` & `tailwind.config.js`
   - Favicon is generated by [@nuxt/pwa](https://pwa.nuxtjs.org/). You should change the `static/icon.png` to something new, and then match the new filename and source in `nuxt.config.js` under `pwa.icon`. Replace the preview.jpg as well.
   - Content is managed mainly in [local Netlify CMS](http://localhost:3000/admin) by going to your `/admin`, in development mode by double-clicking on a post or by hand in `/content`
   - Content collections are managed in `static/admin/config.yml`

4. Change font

   1. Add/change your font link in `nuxt.config.js` under `head.link`. You can add a `<link rel="stylesheet" href="font.css">` as `link: [{ rel: 'stylesheet', href: 'font.css' }]`, like [this](https://vue-meta.nuxtjs.org/api/#link)
   2. Then append your font name in `tailwind.config.js` under `theme.extend.fontFamily.sans` (or other). Like `sans: ['Inter', ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans]`
   3. Then if you've uncommented the included netlify plugin "[Subfont](https://github.com/Munter/netlify-plugin-subfont#readme)" in `netlify.toml`, it will automatically post-processes your web page to use an optimal font loading strategy.

## More info

> This project was bootstrapped with `create-nuxt-app`. There are more detailed explanations of how everything works in the [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

### Netlify Identity

Make sure to set to "registration invite only" [here](https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR_NETLIFY_SITE_SLUG/settings/identity#registration-preferences) if you don't want spam.

When you create your first account, _don‚Äôt_ sign up using OAuth, generate a new password and sign in that way locally, otherwise a successful login will send you to the URL you typed in instead of keeping you on localhost.

## Troubleshooting

- > I added a CSS class, but it doesn't show
- It is most likely purged by PurgeCSS, make sure it is whitelisted in `purgeCSS` in `nuxt.config.js`

- > I tried logging into/saving in Netlify CMS, but I can't
- It may be that you haven't [enabled Netlify Identity](https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR_NETLIFY_SITE_SLUG/settings/identity) or [setup the Git Gateway](https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR_NETLIFY_SITE_SLUG/settings/identity#services) correctly, [check the docs](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/git-gateway-backend/)

- > "This repository is configured for Git LFS but 'git-lfs' was not found on your path."
- Install git-lfs then run `git lfs install` in project root. Then to download the images, run `git lfs pull`. Or if you don't want to download the files/can't login to the lfs server, run `git lfs install --skip-smudge` instead.

- > I can‚Äôt get Git LFS to run correctly on Netlify
- Make sure that you have in your [Netlify build settings](https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR_NETLIFY_SITE_SLUG/settings/deploys#environment-variables), set the environment variable `GIT_LFS_ENABLED` : `true`. Then also make sure that Netlify LM is setup as [their docs](https://docs.netlify.com/large-media/setup/) specify.
